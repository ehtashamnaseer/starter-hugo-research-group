Currently I am a PhD candidate and my area of research is microwave remote sensing. Previously I have worked on air pollution monitoring using remote sensing and ground stations data in Lahore, Pakistan. This research work was related to the development of machine learning model to estimate the surface level concentrations of NO2 pollutant using remote sensing and other meteorological data as input.
